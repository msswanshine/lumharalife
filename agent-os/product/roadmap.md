> Notes
> - Order items by technical dependencies and product architecture
> - Each item should represent an end-to-end (frontend) functional and testable feature
> - The aesthetic styling (item 11) should be applied progressively as features are built, but dedicated time ensures the watercolor/brushstroke vision is fully realized
> - Contact information and method can be simple (email link) or more sophisticated (contact form) depending on needs
> - Newsletter signup can be integrated into the footer, a dedicated section, or both depending on design preferences
