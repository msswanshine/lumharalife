## Raw Idea

Basic HTML structure and minimal hamburger navigation — Set up semantic HTML5 structure with header, main content areas, and a minimal hamburger menu navigation that includes necessary jump links (to sections on the homepage) and/or links to separate pages (About Me, etc.), maintaining a clean, uncluttered appearance.
