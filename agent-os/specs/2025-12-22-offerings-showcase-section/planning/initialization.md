# Initial Description: Offerings Showcase Section

## Feature Description
Create an offerings showcase section on the homepage that displays Lumhara's workshops, mini-courses, and other services. The section should feature the next upcoming event prominently at the top, followed by a card-based grid of other offerings. Focus should be on workshops and mini-courses rather than one-on-one sessions, with the concept of workshops and courses as part of a "Dojo" experience.
