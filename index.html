                    <p>
                        I’ve been interested in personal development for most of my life, but my understanding of it entirely transformed after my first
                        Human Design reading, which helped me see patterns I had been living inside without fully understanding. That experience showed me
                        how much relief can come from understanding how we’re wired rather than trying to fix ourselves. I’m a Certified Life
                        Coach, and my work has been shaped by years of study in human systems and behavior, informed by frameworks such as the
                        Gene Keys, created by Richard Rudd, and mind–body perspectives on belief and biology.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        I was raised in a household that held both structured, rational worldviews and more intuitive, exploratory ways of
                        thinking, which naturally shaped my interest in bridging science, systems, and inner experience. Alongside coaching, I
                        bring a background in technology, systems thinking, music, and the practice of aikido (Japanese martial art), all of which inform how I
                        approach growth and change. At the heart of my work is helping people slow down, listen more closely to themselves,
                        and learn to trust the signals already present within them so change can unfold in a grounded and sustainable way.

                        <p>I uniquely combine Human Design, Gene Keys, Astrology, and Enneagram with neuroscience-backed tools from Neuroplasticity, Meditation, Visualization, and Life Coaching for deeper insights and more effective transformation.</p>

                        <p>"Amy left a lasting impact on me within a week of meeting her. Amy Swan has a gift. She is a natural coach and it is clear that her ability comes not just from professional training, but also from her intuition, intelligence and kindness, as well as her own life experiences. I will continue to utilize Amy as the amazing resource that she is. Five stars all the way!"</p>

                        <p>"My heart is filled with gratitude for the safe, gentle, and authentic space that Amy created for me in our meeting. Something that I sincerely appreciate about Amy is that whenever I asked her a series of questions that my mind felt bogged down with, she didn't forcefully tell me what to do or pressure me to think a certain way. Instead, she gently guided me to a space of peace and calmness so that I could find any answer I seek from within me. And this empowered me."</p>

                        <p>"Amy is a great listener and "tuned" into me almost immediately when I worked with her during an introductory session, she presented several helpful tools and ideas to get me out of my current "funk". Amy is very open and easy to talk to and has had a similar journey from music to web development as well as fitness goals. I can't wait to keep working with Amy to help unlock what's holding me back from my true potential."</p>
