                    <p class="about-lead">My name is Amy Swan, and I'm a Human Systems Guide & Coach. I help people discover their authentic selves and navigate the world in ways that honor their unique design.</p>
                    <p>The name "Lumhara" combines "Lum" (luminate) and "Hara" (unique personal core in Japanese), reflecting my mission to illuminate each person's unique essence. Through an integrated approach combining Human Systems such as Human Design, Gene Keys, I-Ching, Enneagram, Neuroscience, and more, I guide you to discover your authentic self and navigate life with greater clarity and compassion.</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <div class="about-story-content">
                <p>My own journey of self-discovery led me to understand that true transformation begins by learning to listen to the inner guidance that rests within each of us. I've experienced firsthand the confusion and disconnection that comes from not understanding one's authentic nature, and I've discovered the profound peace that comes from honoring your unique design.</p>
                <p>Through my studies and practice, I've learned that we don't need to fix ourselves—we need to understand ourselves. Every part of us, including the shadow aspects, has wisdom to offer. My approach embraces all aspects of your being with awareness, love, and understanding, helping you become the greatest expression of yourself while bringing compassion to every part of your journey.</p>

                <div class="about-approach-item">
                    <h3>Integrated Human Systems</h3>
                    <p>Unlike single-system approaches, I uniquely combine Human Design, Gene Keys, Astrology, and Enneagram with neuroscience-backed tools from Neuroplasticity, Meditation, Visualization, and Life Coaching. This multi-layered approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of who you are, resulting in deeper insights and more effective transformation.</p>

                <div class="about-approach-item">
                    <h3>Compassionate Shadow Work</h3>
                    <p>Many approaches focus only on positive aspects, but I believe in addressing the "darker parts" of ourselves with awareness, love, and compassion. This results in more complete integration and authentic expression, rather than suppression or denial of difficult aspects. We honor all parts of ourselves, knowing that each has wisdom to offer.</p>

                <div class="about-approach-item">
                    <h3>Inner Guidance First</h3>
                    <p>My goal is to teach you to listen to the inner guidance that rests within yourself. As Rumi said, "The universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything that you want, you already are." I don't tell you what to do—I guide you to find your own answers from within, empowering you to trust your unique way of navigating the world.</p>

            <h2>How I Work</h2>
            <div class="about-work-content">
                <p>I offer one-on-one sessions, workshops, and mini-courses that help you understand and apply Human Systems to your real-world situations. Whether you're seeking personal transformation, better relationships, or business team optimization, I work with you to integrate your unique design into your daily life.</p>
                <p>My workshops and courses are designed like a Dojo experience—I demonstrate and guide, and you practice and integrate. Through group work, individual reflection, and practical application, you learn to recognize and honor your authentic nature in real-time situations.</p>
                <p>I also offer business consulting services, helping organizations understand personnel dynamics through Human Systems. By identifying individual strengths and optimizing team dynamics, we create more harmonious and effective workplaces where people can thrive in roles that match their natural design.</p>

                <p>Together, we'll illuminate your unique personal core and help you navigate the world in ways that honor who you truly are. Every part of you is welcome here—the light and the shadow, the strengths and the challenges, the known and the yet-to-be-discovered.</p>
